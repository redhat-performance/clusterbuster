# ClusterBuster: Run workloads on [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) clusters from the command line

ClusterBuster is a command line tool to run a variety of workloads on
OpenShift 4 clusters.  It was created with the following goals in
mind:

- *Stress the cluster*: it was originally written in 2019 to simplify
  running scalable workloads as part of [testing to 500 pods per
  node](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/500_pods_per_node).  It now
  supports many additional workloads, but all of them can be used for
  stress testing.

- *Benchmarking clusters*: this tool is used by the Red Hat
  Performance and Scalability organization to benchmark clusters.  It
  collects performance data about each benchmark it runs, and also
  collects Prometheus metrics data.

- *Command-line focus and scriptability*: ClusterBuster is a
  traditional Linux command line tool.  It is script-friendly and easy
  to use as a component of a larger test system.  One of the tools
  included is a performance CI suite that runs ClusterBuster many times
  and packages the results.  If you prefer using the command line to
  writing YAML, ClusterBuster may be the tool for you.

- *Modularity*: it is possible to add additional workloads by simply
  adding a few files.

- *Reporting*: ClusterBuster generates reports for both single runs
  and multiple ones, creating text output that can be further
  processed with traditional command line tools.

ClusterBuster supports all workloads running in pods, [Red Hat
OpenShift
Virtualization](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/virtualization)
VMs, and [OpenShift sandboxed
containers](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_sandboxed_containers/1.4/html-single/openshift_sandboxed_containers_user_guide/index).
ClusterBuster arranges for orchestration of workloads and
synchronization between all pods/VMs so that all benchmark steps start
simultaneously.

## Supported Workloads

ClusterBuster currently supports the following workloads:

- *cpusoaker* -- a simple loop in Python that can be used either as a
  very rough measure of CPU performance or a load generator.

- *files* -- create, read, and delete large numbers of files to stress
  filesystem handling.

- *fio* -- the [Flexible I/O
  tester](https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fio_doc.html) for
  testing storage performance.  This is not a fully general front end
  to fio; it supports basic I/O patterns.

- *memory* -- allocate, free, and optionally use large chunks of
  memory.

- *server* -- client-server message exchange.

- *sysbench* -- a [multi-threaded system stress/benchmark
  tool](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench).

- *uperf* -- a [network performance tool](https://uperf.org/) front end.

In addition, these "dummy" workloads are available:

- *byo* -- run a workload of your choice under ClusterBuster.

- *failure* -- run pods that deliberately fail. Intended for testing
  ClusterBuster itself.

- *waitforever* -- dummy test, runs a workload that waits forever.
  This can be used to create pods or VMs that persist as
  infrastructure for running non-ClusterBuster workloads.

All supported workloads are under the [lib/workloads](lib/workloads)
directory.
